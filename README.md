Purpose: To build a raymarched voxel renderer in C using Vulkan

## Project Goals

**At a high level, I hope...**

- To gain a deeper understanding of of realtime non-rasterized rendering techniques, and attempt to build a game engine that takes full advantage of the capabilities of modern graphics hardware. 
- To build a flexible, modular, and efficient rendering engine, with careful care of memory management, and to apply data-oriented design principles to the project.
- To implement a global illumination system that can handle complex lighting scenarios, and to implement a physically-based rendering system that can handle a wide variety of materials.
- To create an entity-component system that can handle a wide variety of game objects, and to implement a scripting system that can handle complex game logic.
- To create a primative GUI to allow for the creation of scenes, and build a tool chain that fits the workflow of technically-inclined artist.

## Tools and Libraries
- `Vulkan`: For rendering
- `GLFW`: For window management
- `GLM`: For math
- ...likely more to do with loading models, textures, etc.

Otherwise, setting up a base layer will be created by me, and I will be writing the renderer from scratch.

# Overview

This report covers the development of `raxel` within the past quarter. These developments include, but are not limited to:

* The implementation of a Vulkan-based rendering pipeline, that relies on compute shaders for raymarching.
* The development of a voxel data structure that is used to store and render voxel data.
* The implementation of a basic input system that allows for user interaction with the engine.
* The creation of a basic logging system that allows for debugging and logging of engine events.
* The development of a basic windowing system that allows for the creation of windows and surfaces.
* The implementation of a basic memory allocator that is used throughout the engine.
* The creation of a command line interface that allows for easy building and running of the engine, and for the creation of new projects.
